# GitHub Actions for DDLC Mods

This is a CI template to get you started on automated builds using GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions is a brand new tool announced by GitHub to write workflows to automate a lot of tasks on GitHub, ranging from continuous integration builds to adding comments on pull requests made by first-time contributors.

> Note: At time of writing, GitHub Actions is still in private beta.

## Using GitHub Actions

To get started, drag the `scripts` directory and the `.github/workflows` directory to the root of your repository project. Feel free to take a look at `build.yml` to see how writing a workflow is done!

Most of the hard work is done for us through custom actions written by both Sayo-nika and Project Alice.
